    <section><h1>Hello, ECE 140A! My Name is Anderson, and I am a third year EE Major</h1>
      <p>One of my current professional goals are to land an internship for this upcoming summer, and some
        of my hobbies include camping, outdoor canoeing, dragon boat racing, and playing videogames.

    <h2>Highschool Robotics Team Driver</h2>
    <p>For two years in highschool I had the privelege for being the driver for my
      highschool VEX Robotics Team. This meant that aside from my duties maintaining our competition 
      robot, I also was able to experience handling the robot doing what it was meant to do - compete.
      Looking back, this was one of my favorite parts of highschool because I was able to do creative
      engineering work in a team, and see my creations perform under high pressure at the closest level

    <h2>UCSD DragonBoat Team Treasurer</h2>
    <p>For the past year I've been serving as the Treasurer of the DragonBoat Club at UCSD. What entails
      is the collection and handling of club funds for things like races, equipment, and team maintenance. While
      I do enjoy being able to give back to a club that I've found so much enjoyment in, there is also the added
      pressure of having to work with large sums of money - and other people's money at that
    </p>
    <h2>IOT Integrated Stocking Shelf</h2>
    <p>As a personal project, a friend and I developed a shelf which used RFID stickers to track inventory
      on a modular shelf that we also built. The whole project took about 3 months to put together, and we had to write code which
      would alert us if a product was running low/missing, and also deal with the hardware side of putting the shelf together.
      Looking back, it was a very positive experience as it was my first time actually building a product that integrated hardware
      and software, and working together with my friend was very nice.
