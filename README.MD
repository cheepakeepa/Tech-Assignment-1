The purpose of this asssignment is to familiarize myself with rudimentary python and the usage of fastapi in order to create a server. 

In Tutorial 1 we learned how to use Git and Github which are useful in development both in terms of backing up code but also to work collaboratively.

In  Tutorial 2 we learned how to install Anaconda which is useful when using python as it is a package manager which will help prevent between versions

In Tutorial 3 we learned the basics of python such as variable type and how to make comments which are necessary for documentation. Going through the quirks of python such as the ability to combine different data types within a list also help familiarize with the language

In Tutorial 4 we learned how to throw up a server using a virtual machine which our client could interact with as the client, as well as how to use html in order to display images on our website. In addition we learned how to JSON which is useful as it is in the same format as a Python dictionary.


In Challenge 1:

of the experiences that have been important to me
